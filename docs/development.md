# Zeteo Development

I have a dream that I can create an Elasicsearch command line interface using TypeScript and node. I don't really know TypeScript very well, nor node. I know Elasticsearch well enough though, and it looks like there is a very good Javascript/Typespcript client for Elasticsearch. And I've got my friend, Copilot :copilot: to help me out.

## Getting Started

I saw this article [Building a Node.js CLI with TypeScript, packaged and distributed via Homebrew](https://medium.com/geekculture/building-a-node-js-cli-with-typescript-packaged-and-distributed-via-homebrew-15ba2fadcb81) and will use this as a starting point.



## Testing

Ok, what testing environment should I use?

Our company uses Jest, let's try ava !
